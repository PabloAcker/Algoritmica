A palindromic number or numeral palindrome is a 'symmetrical' number like 16461 that remains the same when its digits are reversed. In this problem you will be given two integers i j, you have to find the number of palindromic numbers between i and j (inclusive).

Input
Input starts with an integer T (≤ 200), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case starts with a line containing two integers i j (0 ≤ i, j ≤ 1017).

Output
For each case, print the case number and the total number of palindromic numbers between i and j (inclusive).
