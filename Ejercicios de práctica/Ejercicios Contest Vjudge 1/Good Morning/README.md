Good morning! This is your 5am wake-up call! A partly cloudy day is expected with light rain coming afternoon…

You have just woken up. You desperately need coffee… and… more coffee… and some cereal. And your clothes. And coffee.

To prepare warm cereal, you put some milk into a microwave, trying to heat it for kk seconds. You must enter kk on the microwave keyboard:

Figure 1: Keyboard layout
As you still haven’t had your coffee, your hand (along with eyes and brain) keeps falling down. You are only able to enter a number if your hand would only move downwards and/or to the right. You cannot go back left, nor move your hand up, though you can press the same key again. And again…and again…

For example, you can enter the number 180180 or 4949, but not 9898 or 132132. Enter a number that is as close to kk as possible. If there are two solutions, enter any one of them. You are too sleepy to actually care. And you need coffee.

Input
The first line of input contains the number of test cases TT (1 \leq T \leq 2001≤T≤200). The descriptions of the test cases follow:

Each test case consists of one line containing an integer kk (1 \leq k \leq 2001≤k≤200).

Output
For each test case, output a number that is closest to kk which can be entered on the keyboard.
