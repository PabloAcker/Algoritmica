Input
The first line of input consists of two integers NN and QQ, where 1 \le N \le 1\, 000\, 0001≤N≤1000000 is the number of elements in the base set and 0 \le Q \le 1\, 000\, 0000≤Q≤1000000 is the number of operations. Then follow QQ lines, one per operation. There are two types of operations:

“= aa bb” indicate that the sets containing aa and bb are joined

“? aa bb” is a query asking whether aa and bb belong to the same set

In both cases, aa and bb are distinct integers between 00 and N-1N−1.

Output
For each query output a line containing “yes” if aa and bb are in the same set, and “no” otherwise.
